[clini](https://www.clini.co.uk) is an app designed to streamline the extraction of medical data from clinical documents, and generate patient-friendly reports using AI. 

Medical test results need to be relayed in a way that is clear and easy to understand, and with interpretation and advice based on the recipient's particular issues.

The secure [clini]((https://www.clini.co.uk)) app allows results and medical information to be collated, then generating a detailed and professional report which can be shared. All data is encrypted and no data is stored, once the report is done.
