The [Ishihara Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishihara_test) is used to detect red–green color blindness.

Created in 1917 by Japanese ophthalmologist Shinobu Ishihara (pictured below), the test uses a series of colored dot patterns called plates, which reveal numbers or shapes only visible to those with normal or deficient color vision.

Some plates are designed to be seen by everyone, while others hide digits or shapes depending on a person's type of color deficiency.

Ishihara's full test consists of 38 plates, but the existence of a deficiency is usually apparent after only a few plates such as the selection above.
