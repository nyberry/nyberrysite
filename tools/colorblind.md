### Ishihara Color Vision Test

The [Ishihara Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishihara_test) is the most widely used method for detecting red–green color blindness. Created in 1917 by Japanese ophthalmologist Shinobu Ishihara, the test uses a series of colored dot patterns called plates, which reveal numbers or shapes only visible to those with normal or deficient color vision.

The full test consists of 38 plates, but the existence of a severe deficiency is usually apparent after only a few plates. Some plates are designed to be seen by everyone, while others hide digits or shapes depending on a person's type of color deficiency — making it a fast and accurate screening tool. 

The eight plates above contain these numbers:
7, 6, 26, 15
6, 73, 5, 16
